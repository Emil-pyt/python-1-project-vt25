# python-1-project-vt25
This is a python programming assignment in a Python introduction course. The task is to take inspiration from the old game Zork (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUagi41Wo0).
The solution is done object oriented with a class called room. 
The idea of this game is to under two min collect specified items in a specified order otherwise you will die if the time runs out.
To gain more time you can get a health smoothie but there is only four of them to be collected.
If you try to get out of the house with the wrong items you will get pushed back to the house and the items you have collected will be put in random rooms.
